# Contributing
Constructive input is always welcome. Contributing to this project is possible and limited to:

- Becoming a maintainer (_you can't, unless I contact you_)
- Discussing the current state of the code/guide
- Proposing new ideas
- Reporting a problem
- Submitting a fix

## Hosting Code & Tracking issues
I use GitHub & GitLab to host the guide, code & to keep an eye on the current issues and possible feature requests. Pull requests are been reviewed manually.

## I use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests under the following conditions.

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested add your tests in a separate file (if possible)
3. If you've changed the documentation.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainer(s) if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
I use GitHub & GitLab issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Do not abuse the issue ticket system for pointless discussions, harassment or personal fights - keep all conversations to a minimum.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Use the issue template
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific, as much as possible!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- Include a "What you expected would happen"
- What actually happens (in case there is a problem)
- Other stuff which could be interesting or important


**Bad Bug Reports** tend to have:

- Pointless discussions
- No point at all
- No detailed steps to reproduce
- Not enough resources included
- Are simply off-topic


## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Check all files for the correct encoding and use standard Editors like VS Code because they tend to be less problematic.
